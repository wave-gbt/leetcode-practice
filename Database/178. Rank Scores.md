Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

**SQL**
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT s2.Score,s1.Rank From
(
SELECT S1.Score, COUNT(*) as Rank
    FROM 
        (SELECT DISTINCT Score from Scores) as S1,
        (SELECT DISTINCT Score from Scores) as S2 
        Where S1.Score<=S2.Score
        Group By S1.Score
) s1 ,Scores s2 
WHERE s1.Score = s2.Score Order BY s2.Score desc
```
